# Initial Commit

*Published: Fri, 4th July 2025 by Michael Ishri*

I'm new to this.

I'm not new to the tech industry or to knowledge sharing or even documenting my experiences. In fact, I've been working in tech over 20 years now, but I am new to sharing my experiences publicly. I've always wanted to but have always felt that maybe I wouldn't have anything interesting to share or that I wouldn't be able to find the time to be consistently sharing so why bother starting. 

But I just need to start, today, right now!

So here I am, I've started. Stay tuned for more.
